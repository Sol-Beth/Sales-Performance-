Consultation: In our initial consultation with the client, the focus was on developing two dashboards aimed at aiding stakeholders, particularly sales managers and executives, in analyzing sales performance.

Dashboard: Sales Performance Overview
Key Performance Indicators (KPI) Overview: This section will provide a concise snapshot of total sales, profits, and quantity for both the current and previous years. Utilizing Bans for clarity and efficiency in displaying main metrics.
Sales Trend Analysis: Monthly data will be presented to showcase sales trends, facilitating easy identification of peak and trough months.Employing sparkline charts to effectively illustrate sales trends over time, with emphasis on maximum and minimum values.
Product Subcategory Comparison: A comparison of sales performance across different product subcategories for the current and previous years will be presented, along with a comparison of sales and profit. Utilizing bar charts, specifically a bar in bar chart, to compare sales and profit across different product subcategories.
Weekly Sales and Profit Trends: Implementing line charts for visualizing weekly sales and profit data.
Furthermore, the dashboards will be equipped with user-friendly parameters, enabling flexibility in selecting desired years. Interactive filtering options will enhance user experience, allowing for deeper exploration of the data.

In refining my approach, I've learned the importance of minimalist design to avoid overwhelming viewers with unnecessary visuals. Clear labeling and intuitive tooltips ensure that users can easily interpret the data. Additionally, the strategic use of markers in the subcategory comparison aids in quickly identifying areas of concern, enhancing decision-making. Lastly, labeling containers and utilizing Tableau's features for layout optimization streamline dashboard creation and ensure accuracy.
